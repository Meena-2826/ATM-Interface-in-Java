The ATM Interface project is a Java-based console application that replicates the essential functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine. It offers features such as secure user authentication, balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, deposit, fund transfer, and transaction history. Developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, the project ensures modularity and secure handling of user data. It includes robust error handling to manage invalid inputs, insufficient funds, and other exceptions gracefully. The application can store user data and transaction records using file handling or integrate with a database for persistent data management. This project demonstrates practical Java skills and is a strong foundation for adding advanced features like a graphical user interface (GUI) or real-time database integration. It serves as a valuable learning experience for developers exploring real-world applications of Java.
